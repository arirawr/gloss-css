NEVER AGAIN.\r\n\r\nIf style is an afterthought, Gloss is for you. Link in a Gloss (generated linkable open-source style sheet) with one line of code.\r\n\r\nGloss is designed as a **final touch** for simple web applications. It is a light-weight alternative to Bootstrap and other frameworks *for those who only use the UI (fonts, colours, sizing, etc.) elements*. It is **not** an alternative grid system [though that is planned for the future].\r\n\r\nGloss works best for applications with no other style sheets and few positioning requirements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
