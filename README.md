# gloss-css
Gloss CSS (Generated Linkable Open-Source Style Sheets) is a set of ready-made style sheets to improve UI in an instant.

Black Times New Roman on a white background with no padding and default buttons. NEVER AGAIN.

If style is an afterthought, Gloss is for you. Link in a Gloss (generated linkable open-source style sheet) with one line of code.

Gloss is designed as a **final touch** for simple web applications. It is a light-weight alternative to Bootstrap and other frameworks *for those who only use the UI (fonts, colours, sizing, etc.) elements*. It is **not** an alternative grid system [though that is planned for the future].

Gloss works best for applications with no other style sheets and few positioning requirements.

## How to Use Gloss

**1. Select your gloss.**

**2. Copy your link.**

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://glosscss.com/gloss/matte.css"/>`

**3. Paste your link within your `<head>` tags.**

**4. Reload your application and enjoy!**
